# Strapi Chat

Automate Stripe site creation with LangChain + OpenAPI + LLM.

See [OpenAPI | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/toolkits/openapi) for more details on usinig LLMs to interact with OpenAPI APIs.

## Context

### Strapi

**Strapi** is an open-source, headless CMS (Content Management System) designed to help developers manage and deliver content via APIs. It offers a customizable backend with support for dynamic content modeling, making it ideal for building flexible and scalable content-driven applications.

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

**APIs** are intermediaries that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. They define rules and protocols for accessing functionality or data, enabling seamless integration between systems, such as retrieving data from a CMS like Strapi or connecting to third-party services.

### Large Language Model (LLM)

**LLM** refers to advanced AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. These models, such as GPT or T5, leverage billions of parameters to perform tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. Their versatility makes them a cornerstone for modern AI applications.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach in artificial intelligence that combines a retrieval system with a generative model to generate more accurate, contextually relevant, and knowledge-grounded responses. It is commonly used in applications like question answering, content generation, and conversational AI.

### LangChain, LangGraph, and Agents

**LangChain** is a framework designed to build advanced applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It enables seamless integration of language models with tools, external data, and workflows, making it easier to create context-aware, interactive, and robust AI-driven systems.

**LangGraph** extends LangChain by introducing graph-based workflows, where nodes represent logical steps (e.g., data retrieval, decisions, or tool actions) and edges define the flow of information. This enables modular and transparent AI application development with complex reasoning paths.

**Agents** in LangChain are dynamic systems that use LLMs to decide which actions to take, such as calling tools, querying data sources, or performing computations. They follow structured reasoning steps (e.g., ReAct) to handle user inputs interactively and adaptively.

## Atchitecture

### ‚ùå Option 1 - OpenAPI Agent

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROPOSAL** - The use of the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for the API calls instead of manual configuration is not yet confirmed. We need to verify how it handles different cases and if the results are consistent.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph StrapiChat
      P[/Prompt/] --> LC["OpenAPI Agent"]
      AD[/APIs definition/] --> LC
      LC -.-> LLM[LLM] -.-> LC
    end
    LC -.-> |calls|SA[Strapi APIs]
```

Using LangChain's OpenAPI agent, we can automate API calls. By crafting the right prompt,
we can guide the agent to execute a specific sequence of calls, detailing the input parameters
for each request and the information to extract from the responses.

The diagram below illustrates a sample RAG flow using the LangChain OpenAPI agent to interact with Strapi APIs.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>StrapiChat: Build site bla bla bla
    StrapiChat->>OpenAPI Agent: Prompt + API Definition
    OpenAPI Agent->>LLM: What APIs should be used?
    LLM->>OpenAPI Agent: API x, y, z with params a, b, c.
    OpenAPI Agent->>Strapi APIs: Call API x with param a
    Strapi APIs->>OpenAPI Agent: Response API x
    Note over OpenAPI Agent,Strapi APIs: Interaction continues eventually <br /> also mapping and adjusting the input
    OpenAPI Agent->>StrapiChat: Agent Logs
    StrapiChat->>User: Final feedback
```

### ‚úÖ Option 2 - Custom Strapi Agent with LangGraph

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROPOSAL** - In this approach we create a customized agent, which is able to use predefined tools to interact with Strapi APIs.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph StrapiChat
      P[/Prompt/] --> LC["Custom Strapi Agent"]
      AD[/Custom Tools/] --> LC
      LC -.-> LLM[LLM] -.-> LC
    end
    LC -.-> |calls|SA[Strapi APIs]
```

## Getting started

The strapi Chat needs acsess to a running htc instance, and we need to create and connect our acsess token to Strapi:

If needed, create a virtual environmet, activate it, and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```bash
python langchain_strapi_assistant.py
```


## Environment Setup

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```bash
STRAPI_API_KEY=<your_strapi_api_key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Version Compatibility**: Ensure that 
- **API Key Issues**: If you encounter authorization errors, verify that the `.env` file contains the correct API keys.
- **Cache Issues**:restart your environment and reload .env variables if necessary.
